Hummingbot is a local software client that helps you run trading strategies that automate the execution of orders and trades on various cryptocurrency exchanges and protocols.

## Releases

Hummingbot's code is publicly hosted at <https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot>, and the `development` branch is continually updated.

Approximately once a month, we publish an official release of Hummingbot onto the `master` branch. See [Releases](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/releases).
