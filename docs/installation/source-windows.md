# Source on Windows via WSL

## Prerequisites

The Hummingbot codebase is designed and optimized for UNIX-based systems such as macOS and Linux. For Windows users, we recommend running Hummingbot in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

- You must be running Windows 10 version 2004 and higher (Build 19041 and higher) or Windows 11

- Virtualization needs to be enabled under your BIOS setting.
