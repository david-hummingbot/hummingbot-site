1. In Hummingbot client, type these commands 
    1. `create`
        1. `pure_market_making`
        2. `dexalot_avalanche_dexalot`

In addition, ensure also that you have appropriate balances of tokens that you wish to trade with. In this guide, we will be trading ALOT-USDC pair. So, we have manually traded to get ALOT and USDC.

Finally, we need to add ALOT in the gas tank. ALOT will be used for gas fees for every activity that the bot will perform. Click on 3 vertical dots at right side of ALOT, and select Add Gas. For amount, we usually set 5-10 ALOT which will last for few weeks or a month.

### **Utilizing DIP and Multiverse Programs**

1. The Dexalot Incentive Program (DIP) 
    1. Giving away up to 4.8 Million $ALOT
    2. A 2-year program which started on Q1 2023, & ending on Q1 2025
    3. Total Monthly rewards of 200,000 ALOT Tokens 
    4. Rewards are updated daily at Leaderboard, and distributed the next month after you started trading the eligible pairs. Specifically, rewards are released on 7th, 14th, 21st, & 28th day, depending on your total reward amount.
    5. Refer to this blog post for details on how [DIP rewards are calculated](https://medium.com/dexalot/the-dexalot-incentive-program-1d55c869a6c0).
2. The Multiverse Program
    1. Up to $3 Million in AVAX tokens by Avalanche Foundation
    2. A 1-year program which started on Sep 2023, & ending on Sep 2024
    3. Total monthly rewards are unknown as teams have internal metrics that determines quantity to be unlocked based on user growth, adoption, & trading volume at Dexalot platform.
    4. Rewards are calculated only at end of the month.
    5. Refer to this blog post for details on the [Multiverse Program](https://medium.com/dexalot/dexalot-multiverse-c4887aedf301)
3. Experience Sharing
    1. Note that if you are using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) while accessing the Dexalot App, you may encounter functionality issues. To ensure seamless operation, we recommend disabling your VPN or reconfiguring its settings to allow proper access to the Dexalot App. 
    2. Pay close attention to your ALOT balance, as ALOT is the token used for paying gas fees on the Dexalot subnet. Although the gas fees are relatively low, the frequent refreshing of orders, especially when you have multiple order levels, can quickly deplete your ALOT balance and incur substantial costs. To keep your expenses under control, we recommend setting the order refresh interval to 30-60 minutes or longer, and limiting your orders to a single or few levels. 
    3. Aside from saving on gas fees by setting a longer order refresh interval, keeping your limit orders in the order book for an extended period before they are filled or executed can also earn you additional rewards. This incentivizes traders to place orders with patience and let them stay in the order book, rather than frequently canceling and replacing orders, which can incur higher gas fees.
    4. Ensure that the limit orders are inside the blue bands (i.e within 2 standard deviations of mid-price) in order to be eligible for rewards

5. The rewards you earn are primarily determined by your filled orders and overall trading volume. However, the amount of rewards can fluctuate daily, depending on the volatility of the specific market pair you are trading. Generally, weekends tend to have lower trading activity, as many automated trading bots seem to be less active during those periods. Consequently, the rewards you can potentially earn may be lower on weekends due to the reduced trading volume.
6. After observing the platform's performance over the past 9 months, it appears that under typical market conditions, without any extreme market crashes or volatility, traders can expect to generate a net monthly profit ranging from 5% to 20% of their deployed capital on Dexalot. These figures represent the potential earnings during periods of relatively stable and normal market movements. Note though that profits are NOT guaranteed.
7. Let's take a look at the rewards earned in February 2024 as an example. With a capital deployment of 6,300 USDT, the total rewards accumulated for the month were approximately $1,345. This amount translates to around 21% of the initial capital deployed. Due to the recent upward trend in the market over the past few weeks, trading activities have also been profitable, contributing to the overall positive returns.
