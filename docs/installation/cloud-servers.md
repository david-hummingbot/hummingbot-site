## Requirements

For experienced and technical users, we recommend setting up a cloud instance and installing the Docker version or from source. This enables Hummingbot to run 24/7.

Hummingot Docker instances takes up around 500 MB of storage space and 4 GB for Hummingbot Docker image. We have ested to install and run Hummingbot on the following machine types:

| Provider              | Instance Type   | Instance Details      |
| --------------------- | --------------- | --------------------- |
| Google Cloud Platform | g1-small        | 2 vCPU, 4 GB memory |
| Amazon Web Services   | t2.small        | 2 vCPU, 4 GB memory   |
| Microsoft Azure       | Standard_D2s_v3 | 2 vCPU, 8 GB memory   |

These instances are pre-loaded with system files that takes up around 1.2 GB so we recommend having at least **8 GB of storage space** in your cloud server.
